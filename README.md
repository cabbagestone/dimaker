## About the Project

This is a project serving as a beginners portfolio project for my [Journey to Architect](https://blog.arch-texture.com/). Because of that, I need to demonstrate a large subset of the beginner prficiencies I established in my [Developer Skill Matrix](https://arch-texture.com/skill-matrix-for-developers).

Here's a excerpt of the beginner section of the portfolio:

| Skill | Beginner's Proficiency Description |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- | 
| Programming Languages | Familiar with at least one programming language |
| Programming Paradigm | Basic understanding of procedural and/or object-oriented programming |
| Development Platforms | Basic familiarity with a single development platform |
| IDE and Tool Proficiency | Basic usage of a single IDE |
| Database Skills | Basic understanding of databases |
| SDLC + methodologies | Basic understanding of SDLC |
| Performance Optimization and Debugging | Can troubleshoot basic program errors |
| Self Reflection and Learning | Understands and can apply basic problem-solving strategies |
| Algorithms and Data Structures | Basic understanding of algorithms and data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash maps). |
| Version Control Systems | Understanding of the concept of version control. Familiarity with basic Git commands like git clone, git add, git commit, and git push. |
| Computer Hardware | Understanding of the main hardware components (CPU, memory, storage, I/O) and their roles in running software. Awareness of how data is represented in hardware (binary). |

This portfolio should serve to show beginner level proficiency for nearly everything - only the computer hardware component doesn't have a nice integration that I can use in this project to demonstrate proficiency.

I'm excited to get started!
