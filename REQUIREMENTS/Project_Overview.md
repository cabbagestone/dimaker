# Dimaker Project Overview

## Overview Overview

Dimaker aims to be a streamlined decision assistance software for an individual or small group. While there are a large number of decision making softwares out there on the web, a lot of the best ones are corporate focused. Realistically, the featureset of the company focused decision making softwares isn't all that helpful to a single individual anyways. As for the existing decision making software, I think it lacks an element of user friendliness. I want the decisions making process on Dimaker to be as thorough or simple as the user wants it to be. I also want to eventually have informed decisions, where the decisions can rely upon each other, and rely upon values and goals that you can set in Dimaker. I place a strong emphasis on incrementalism in my own life, since I'm doing so many thing, and like it when I can delegate a small amount of extremely effective time to a project each day, over grinding on the project for long periods of time intermittently

## Dimaker values
